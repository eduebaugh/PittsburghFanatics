For my part of the project, we're looking at which neighborhood has the most ballfields in order to be considered for the title of best neighborhood. The neighborhood with the most has been Brighton Heights,  with 4 ballfields. Some other factors that I will consider will be if they're actively in use and if they are in close proximity to my other group member's feature for "best neighborhood".
